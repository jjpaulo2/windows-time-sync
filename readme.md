### Motivation

This is a simple program that fixes the Windows time synchronization, that isn't working for many computers since some update (still unknown) on Windows 10.

Below are 2 pictures, captured in same time on Windows 10, showing the Windows' time settings panel saying that is impossible to do the time sincronization.

If you get a security warning from Windows, just skip it, and accept to run the program. A terminal (like `cmd.exe`) window is going to appears and close fast.

After this, you will find your computer's date and time synced as well.
